    definition:
      "Caustic soda is an alkali salt which is also called Lye. It is the common name of sodium hydroxide. This name is given due to the corrosive nature of this salt on animal and plant tissues. It has a wide range of applications. The chemical formula of sodium hydroxide is NaOH.Caustic soda is a highly versatile chemical used in industries such as manufacturing, water treatment, textiles, pulp and paper, and petroleum refining. Available at 50-99% purity (liquid, gel and solid forms)",
